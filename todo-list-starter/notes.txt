Date format - the HTML5 type='date' automatically offers a widget to pick a date.
However, the date format is in year-month-date.
Option1: convert date via JavaScript after selecting the due date
Option2: use a date picker library that offers different formats

I would prefer option 2, however, for the exercise of practising JavaScript I will convert the date using JavaScript.
